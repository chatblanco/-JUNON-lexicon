Digital Twin (DT): a dynamic virtual representation of a physical object or system through time and across its lifecycle. It is updated from real-time data and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help decision and automate interactions with its physical counterpart.

Shadow Twin (ST): a dynamic virtual representation of a physical object or system through time and across its lifecycle. It is updated from real-time data and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help decision without implementing automate interactions with its physical counterpart.

Junior JUNON Twin (JJT): ST or DT that describe a physical environment (that can be strictly defined by geographical coordinates like a river, observatory zone, ), an experimental device, a real-time simulation (e.g. Meteonappe) or a precise data network (e.g. satellite, piezometric network, air quality network ...)

Senior JUNON Twin (SJT): ST or DT derivated from several JJN.

Territorial JUNON Twin (TJT): SJT that fully covers JUNON observatory zone and answer to a specific set of specifications given by the JUNON Program (e.g. the four DT that were forseen when defining the JUNON Program goals)
